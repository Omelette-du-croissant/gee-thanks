# Google Earth Engine: Water Quality and Wildfire tracker

## Description
  
  This project includes two GEE scripts:
  - FAI Tracker
  - Wildfire Tracker
  
  The FAI tracker was written to monitor the 2021 mucilage event in the Sea of Marmara (sample timeframe: June 2021).
  The wildfire tracker was written to monitor the 2021 wildfires in southern Turkey (sample timeframe: August 2021).
  
## Usage
  
  The geometries and timeframes can be modified to track other similar events.
  
## App
  
  Feel free to take a look at the [GEE Wildfire Tracker](https://nazliaktas.users.earthengine.app/view/wildfire-map-aug-2021-mugla-antalya).
